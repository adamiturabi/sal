# Sample Output

This directory contains `ysr.html` (View here: https://raw.githack.com/adamiturabi/sal/master/sample_output/ysr.html) an HTML file of the kind of output we want to produce. The HTML file is real, in that it has been produced by an Xquery program that works on the input XML. However, the XML has been modified to allow the program to produce the correct output. Our aim is to minimize modification of the input XML that we sources from Alpheios.

The HTML file is for the dictionary root  entry "يسر". You can compare the HTML output to the print version `ysr.png` (in this directory and also below).
